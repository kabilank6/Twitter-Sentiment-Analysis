        "As outlined in Task One, we want to extract the sentiment of each tweet. Before going into this however, it is worth breaking down what we can expect from each sentence, so we understand how to deal with each sentence. To achieve this, we can look at examples from the csv file we are given.\n",

        "We can see from this (and cross inspection with other examples) that there are three specific common parts to each tweet. The @ part (for the Twitter handle of someone being mentioned), the message (in this case it's in one sentence, however in others the tweet's message could be covered through at least two sentences). Lastly, in this and several other cases, there often is an emoji included somewhere (in the sentence mentioned above, we can see it is angry). In some tweets, we can see initials of a company representative replying to a query (for example, \"RR\" in \"@105835 Your business means a lot to us. Please DM your name, zip code and additional details about your concern. ^RR https://t.co/znUu1VJn9r\"). Due to the limited time of this task, I will assume that this will be treated as neutral (as we intuitively would want to treat it) by any sentiment analysis library we use.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this in mind, perhaps the only part of the tweet that might be worth giving special treatment to is the emoji. From doing some research, I found [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57744725/how-to-convert-emojis-emoticons-to-their-meanings-in-python) that suggested a good way to objectively deal with the emoji is to convert it to a relevant word that describes its sentiment well (our choice of model will handle the rest after with the rest of the text). However, it seems unweldy to copy a lot of code for a few specific emojis, and it would be nice if there was a library that did this for us. Fortunately, [VADER Sentiment Analysis](https://pypi.org/project/vader-sentiment/) seems to be good with dealing with UTF-8 encoded emojis, and social media style sentiment analysis, so it is worth looking into it."

        "From my (admittedly subjective) observation, it seems that most of these 'positive' tweets are replies to queries on behalf of a company (perhaps VADER picked up optimistic tones from these via words used politely in this context like 'like', 'help' and 'happy' that tend to be interpreted positively, and this increased their compound scores?). There also tend to be a lot of inclusive pronouns/words like 'we', 'together' and 'our' that may add to this nuance that is interpreted positively by VADER. I also note that positive emojis like \":-)\", \"🤗\" and \"😊\" (to name a few) come up in these tweets, which likely drives the compound score up as we are told that VADER takes them into account. Otherwise, there are some clear positive tweets here too - such as happy customer reviews. For example, \"@AppleSupport Super help - problem solved 😀 once again in love with Apple\" and \"@AppleSupport Okey. Thank you! 🤗\" seem quite positive to me. \n",
        "\n",
        "There also are a few exceptions (where would the fun be if there weren't?). For example, \"Okay @76099 I used my fucking phone for 2 minutes and it drains it down 8 fucking percent\" does not seem positive at all to me (in fact, it clearly seems negative). Perhaps its compound score is relatively high due to the sexual connotations of the \"f word\" (which can be interpreted in a positive or happy way). Also, \"@Uber_Support @115879 wouldn't do this to me 😔\" seems like a disappointed tweet, so if this is the case it shouldn't be considered positive. Perhaps in this case, the algorithm is interpreting the sentence as the tweeter speaking positively about @115879, rather than negatively about @Uber_Support. However, from inspection, these seem to be some relatively rare extreme exceptions, but overall most of the positive classifications seem reasonable to me (although I may not fully agree that each of them should be considered positive overall).\n",

        "While I wouldn't consider seeing if we can adjust the results due to limited time, I think it is worth at least considering that there is an argument that a lot of these more 'nuanced' (that is, using less strong positive words) and less emoji-filled tweets are better placed to be classified as 'neutral' rather than 'positive'. Outside of retraining or changing our model, perhaps we could consider changing the thresholds to deal with these questionable results to fine-tune the model to align with our expectations.\n",
